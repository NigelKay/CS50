                      <h3>Pruning</h3>
                      <p>The most important method of Bonsai training is pruning the shape and size of the tree at regular intervals.
                      The tree should be shaped into an appealing design and maintained all year around. Pruning can be done with special shears to cause the least damage to the Bonsai.</p>

                      <h3>Feeding</h3>
                      <p>Regular feeding of Bonsai is important due to the small pot size. It is important to follow the growing season for Bonsai.
                      Usage of Bonsai fertilizer during early spring to late summer months sees vast benefits. Allowing a winter rest period is common practice.</p>

                      <h3>Wiring</h3>
                      <p>To assist with the shaping process, wiring can be carried out to improve the shape of the tree and its branches.
                      By wrapping wire around the branches, it is possible to reposition the features of the tree.
                      Position tends to set after a few months, at this point it is important to remove the wire to avoid damaging the tree as it grows.</p>
