# CS50
Assignments from HarvardX CS50 course

This repository contains all of my assignement submissions from CS50x. It is worth noting that I took the 'more comfortable' route throughout and scored 100% on all assignments.

In this course I covered:
- C
- Python
- SQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Flask

Below I will give an overview for each of the assignments in the repository (In reverse order).

# Final Project
For the final project I created an automated assignment planner using the Runescape-API, an SQLite database and some algorithms to determine skills. More info included in the specific README.md.

# Week 8 - Web Track
### Finance
This is a flask website using a SQLite database to query, buy, sell and list stocks. This has a session system to handle multiple users.

### Homepage
This is a custom website written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I based this website upon Bonsai trees.

# Week 7 - SQL
### Houses
This assignment looked at importing all data from a CSV into a database file before querying the data with SQL.

### Movies
This is a series of SQL statements for querying the IMDB movies database.

# Week 6 - Python
### hello / mario / credit / readability
These are previous assignments converted from c to python

### DNA
This project looked at sequences of data and STRs to determine whom a DNA sample matched up to.

# Week 5 - Data Stuctures
This assignment looked at data structures within C. The purpose of this was to write a spell checker and stike a good balance between speed and memory by implementing appropriate data structures and algorithms.
This task came with a challenge to come up with a hashing algorithm and compete on a ranked leaderboard for time. I wrote my own algorithm for this instead of researching an existing algorithm. At the time of submission my algorithm was ranked 161st out of 2000+ submissions.

# Week 4 - Memory
### Recover
This task used forensic computing to recover images via looking at bits on a wiped memory card. The bits were reconstructed into JPG images.

### Filter
This task looked at image manipulation through playing directly with the bits in bitmap images. The four effects produced were Greyscale, mirror, blur and edge detection.

# Week 3 - Algorithms
### Tideman
This is an implementation of a tideman voting system.

### Plurality
This is an implementation of a plurality voting system.

# Week 2 - Arrays
### cryptography.c
This task looked at cryptography and used ASCII manipulating for encoding messages.

### readability.c
This application gives an inputted string a reading score based upon the Coleman-Liau Index.

# Week 1 - C
### hello.c
A simple hello world in c

### mario.c
A simple print formatting piece of code

### credit.c
Using C to validate credit cards using Luhn's Algorithm

# Week 0 - Scratch
This was a very high level abstracted view of computer science and programming, the scratch file included is of a game where you must catch falling vials before they hit the floor. Each successful catch increased the speed modifier.
